  		<p>Curiosity is humanity’s greatest trait. We crave on a primal level to understand our universe and our place in it, driving us to imagine new possibilities and pursue enlightenment. If humanity had been complacent and accepted the world as an erratic assembly of uncorrelated events, society would have stagnated. We would not have any of the technologies, the vaccines, computers, and vehicles that have improved our standard of living so monumentally. It is therefore paramount that we continue to actively seek insight into the principles governing our lives and foster intellectual curiosity in future generations. It is realization of this demand that has motivated me to pursue research in gravitational wave astronomy throughout my undergraduate career, graduate studies and beyond. <a href="more.html">Read More...</a><br>
